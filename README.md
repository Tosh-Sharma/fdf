# FDF

## Summary

This project is about representing a landscape as a 3D object
in which all surfaces are outlined in lines.

Version: 2

### How to solve this?

There is Bresenhem's line generation algorithm that we can use to plot points.
However, we still need to take care of things like allowing for rotation and translation.
We also need to take care of zoom.
So we have our work cut out for us.
Let's get to work.
